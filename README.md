# Final-Year-Project
## Project No.: SCSE20-0163
## Title: A Study of Some Vulnerabilities in Information Security

### Project Summary: 
This project aims to explore different types of methods to hide weak implementations in a legitimate program. These methods include the use of strong crypto algorithms. If there is any part in the cryptosystem that is weakly implemented (either ignorantly or deliberately), encrypted data using strong algorithms can still be retrieved easily without the userâ€™s knowledge.
Another method being explored, are hiding vulnerabilities in a program to allow attackers to easily take advantage of a remote command execution and having the ability to evade firewalls and avoiding antivirus programs. Thus, simulating a malicious program and the possibilities of what a hacker can do on a compromised machine.

Specific details:
* Design component
  * Create a software product to integrate an environment for facilitating the testing of weak implementations.

* Implementation component
  * Implement a strong cryptographic algorithm (E.g. AES or RSA).
  * Provide various ways to hide vulnerabilities.

* Research component
  * Enterprising student will create their own weak implementations, beyond what advisor teach them.
  * Student will study vulnerabilities of his choice in information security systems, be it crypto, RNG, protocols or other major areas.

* Development component
  * Student may code using any programming languages to achieve the goal of this project.

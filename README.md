## Title: Ways to Hide Weak Implementations of Strong Crypto Algorithms

### Project Summary: 
The use of strong crypto algorithms to protect data does not mean no one can break the system. If there is any part in the cryptosystem that is weakly implemented (either ignorantly or deliberately), encrypted data using strong algorithms still can be retrieved fairly easily! In this project student will study ways of making cryptosystem using strong algorithms weak. Learning this will enable all to know what to look out for when purchasing encryption products.
Student is expected to be strong in programming and like math.
Weak student will find this project a challenge, so not advisable to take this project. But good students will enjoy doing this project.

Specific details:
* Design component
  * Ways to hide weakness in implementation.


* Implementation component
  * Based on ways in (a), student will write programs to implement algorithm.

* Research component
  * Enterprising student will create their own weak implementations, beyond what advisor teach them.

* Development component
